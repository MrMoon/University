Greatest Strength
	- I have two main strength
		- I have displince, since I've started on my own in the Freelance industry from a very young age, I was taghut how to make most of my time, and get to my goals according to my future plans, which also lead to independence in many areas
		- I have a good foundation in Computer Science, and most importantly math, which leads to being about to learn complex concept in a very short amount of time, and I did that in my last internship at Amazon, where I was able to learn many technical concepts and applies them at Amazon scale
================================================================================================

Biggest Weaekness
	- I lack the ablitiy to see future plans in some small cases, which leads to a short term descision and sometimes even a bad descision, but as I worked I learn how to see the vision of the company and try to match that with my desicions and see the game before it begin in order to also plan other plans for the future

Where do you see yourself in 15 years from now
	- I like to be in a more advance career posision of course, where I solve problems that help billions of people rather than millions, and also try to solve problems in the future right now, as Albert Einstein says, Intellectuals solve problems , geniuses prevent them, all of that while also being surrounded by people who also loves to solve problems
	- I would like to at least work at two of the Big Four (real-world big four (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix)), where I solve customer problems that help people accomplish certain desires or tasks effiently and at big scale.
	- I would like to do at least one big scale volunter project, like for example help world hunger, or a way to solve the general problem in energy/Internet (clean, easy to get and preserve, almost free and avalible for everyone)
